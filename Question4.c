 * Problem Description - This program answers the following question: "What is the allocation method 
 * for the file system? For file systems using indirect block mapping scheme, how many direct 
 * pointers are in the inode? For systems using extent-based scheme, how big is the extent size? 
 * (Hint: think about using write() and fsync() to answer this question. Or use read(). Also, think 
 * about whatâ€™s the differences between the indirect block mapping scheme and the extent-based scheme.)"
 *
 * NOTE: This program assumes that the system being tested uses an extent-based scheme.

 * Function: main - Program will start executing from here.
 * Parameters: 
 *      - None. 
 * Preconditions: 
 *      - An empty 16 GiB file named "LargeTestFile" must be created inside the "/var/tmp/" folder. 
 *      - We assume that the system being tested uses an extent-based scheme.
 * Postconditions: 
 *      - Time (in microseconds) that it takes to write 1 MiB of random data to disk.
 * Return:
 *      - No return value.
