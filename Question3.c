 * Problem Description - This program answers the following question: "How big is the file cache? 
 * (Hint: Repeated reads to a group of blocks that fit in cache will be very fast; repeated reads 
 * to a group of blocks that donâ€™t fit in cache will be slow.)"

 * Function: main - Program will start executing from here.
 * Parameters: 
 *      - None. 
 * Preconditions: 
 *      - A 18GiB file named "Random_1" must be created and populated with random data in the "/var/tmp/" 
 *        folder. 
 *      - We assume that the cache has been flushed multiple times before this program 
 *        is run. 
 *      - The cache size of the system being measured is assumed to be AT MOST 16GiB. 
 * Postconditions: 
 *      - Average time (in microseconds) that it takes to read 256MiB of data a set number of times. The first time 
 *        the second inner for loop is run, a total of 256MiB will be read. The second time the second inner
 *        for loop is run, a total of 512 MiB will be read, and so forth. 
 * Return:
 *      - No return value.
